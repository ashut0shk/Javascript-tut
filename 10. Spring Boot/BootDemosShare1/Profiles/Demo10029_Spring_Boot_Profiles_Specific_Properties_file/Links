1 Parallel Deployment for test (hits test db) and prod(hits production db)
	2 ports, 2 context paths
2 profile specific properties file
3 property file inheritance


first part to have 2 context paths require us to have cutomizers

clean install spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=prod_profile
	spring-boot-prod
	8484
http://localhost:8484/spring-boot-prod/emp/controller/getDetails

clean install spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=test_profile
	spring-boot-test
	8486
	
	http://localhost:8486/spring-boot-test/emp/controller/getDetails
	
	
	
	
	tell then how read the environment variable
	
	random_var in prod is used from parent
	random_var in test is overridern by test properties  file
	
	you cannot print the read property in constructor
	as property is injected after object creation is done by constructor
	
	you can activate multiple profiles in a  single run:
	
clean install spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=prod_profile,test_profile
problem of multiple bean of same type and autowiring conflict
can be resolved using @Qualifier or profiles
