/*

Mediator design pattern is one of the behavioral design pattern, so it deals with the behaviors of objects.

Mediator design pattern is used to provide a centralized communication medium between different objects in a system.

Mediator pattern is used to reduce communication complexity between multiple objects or classes. This pattern provides a mediator class which normally handles all the 
communications between different classes and supports easy maintenance of the code by loose coupling. Mediator pattern falls under behavioral pattern category.

Mediator design pattern is very helpful in an enterprise application where multiple objects are interacting with each other. 
If the objects interact with each other directly, the system components are tightly-coupled with each other that makes higher maintainability cost and not hard to extend. 
Mediator pattern focuses on provide a mediator between objects for communication and help in implementing lose-coupling between objects.

Air traffic controller is a great example of mediator pattern where the airport control room works as a mediator for communication between different flights. 
Mediator works as a router between objects and it can have itâ€™s own logic to provide way of communication.
