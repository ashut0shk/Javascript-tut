Easy Redable

A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.



````
var me = "Bruce Wayne"

function greetMe(){
        console.log("Hello "+ me )

}

greetMe()
````

support for closure
we have access to var outter scope of itself
greetMe remeber outer context even when greetMe called from complete different part of app, it will still ref to outer context



other languages need to pass variable to function
greetMe("Hello World")
