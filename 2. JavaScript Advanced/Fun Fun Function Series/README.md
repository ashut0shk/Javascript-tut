## map

## filter

## reject

## find

## reduce

## advance reduce


## closure

var me = "Bruce Wayne"

function greetMe(){
        console.log("Hello "+ me )

}

greetMe()


support for closure

greetMe remeber outer context even when greetMe called from complete different part of app, it will still ref to outer context

WHY?


other languages need to pass variable to function
greetMe("Hello World")
